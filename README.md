# Machine Learning (Binary Hypothesis Testing) Program for Real-time Patient Monitoring (MATLAB) ECE 313 Final Project
# ECE-313-Final-Project
The Final Project for ECE 313.
1. Used Hypothesis Testing to create decision rules based on input “Training” patient data
2. Program judged input “Testing Data” based on decision rules and created alarms when abnormality in
the data was detected
3. Utilized Correlation Coefficients in MATLAB to help reduce error to 0.001% when detecting for
abnormalities and generating alarms
